# Pokemon-Click-And-Walk
click on a location in a real-time pokemon map and your character will walk over

# Why use this?
On the map it will show you the real-time location of all the pokemons around you, letting you decide which one to catch by just clicking beside it.
Instead of teleporting to a location, this program will make your character walk at a fast but limited speed so it looks like you are just driving/flying.
You can choose to collect pokestops and catch pokemons on the way.

# How to use
1. run the map server
2. change the url to the server in "calculatePath.py"
3. upload the gpx file to your phone
4. click anywhere on the map
